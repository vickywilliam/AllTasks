The provided code snippet appears to have a few issues and can be enhanced for better readability 
and error handling. Here are some suggestions:

Remove the Infinite Loop: The current code snippet uses an infinite loop (while (true)) 
and relies on catching ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to terminate it. This is not a good practice. 
Instead, you can use a for loop to iterate through the args array, which will make the code cleaner
and avoid the need for an exception for control flow.


public class ArrArgs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            for (int k = 0; k < args.length; k++) {
                System.out.println("Value of input is " + k + " and argument is " + args[k]);
            }
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException errorOc) {
            System.err.println("Error occurred " + errorOc.toString());
        }
    }
}
Use a for-each Loop: In this case, you can also use a for-each loop to iterate through the 
args array, which simplifies the code further:


public class ArrArgs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int k = 0;
            for (String arg : args) {
                System.out.println("Value of input is " + k++ + " and argument is " + arg);
            }
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException errorOc) {
            System.err.println("Error occurred " + errorOc.toString());
        }
    }
}
Error Handling: It's better to handle errors gracefully. Instead of just printing the
 error message, you should consider appropriate error handling. For example, you can display 
a user-friendly message to inform the user that the program expects command-line arguments if
no arguments are provided:

public class ArrArgs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Please provide command-line arguments.");
            return;
        }
        
        try {
            int k = 0;
            for (String arg : args) {
                System.out.println("Value of input is " + k++ + " and argument is " + arg);
            }
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException errorOc) {
            System.err.println("Error occurred " + errorOc.toString());
        }
    }
}
