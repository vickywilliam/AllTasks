If a Java Security Manager is installed and the provided program is run, it might encounter 
security exceptions depending on the security policy in place. The exact behavior can vary 
depending on the security manager configuration and the permissions granted to the code.

Here's a breakdown of potential security-related issues:

File Access: The program reads from a file named "input.txt" and writes to a file
 named "output.txt." If the security policy restricts file access, the program may 
encounter a SecurityException when trying to read from or write to these files.

System Properties: The program calls System.getProperty("user.home") to retrieve the 
user's home directory. If the security policy restricts access to system properties,
 it may throw a SecurityException.

Resource Loading: If the program uses classes or resources that are not part of the default 
classpath, it may attempt to load classes or resources from locations that are not allowed by 
the security policy. This could result in a SecurityException.

Network Access: If the program attempts any network operations (e.g., connecting to a remote server)
, it may also be subject to security restrictions related to network access.

Custom Security Policies: If a custom security policy is defined, it can further restrict or
 grant specific permissions to the program.

The specific output and behavior of the program will depend on how the Java Security Manager is 
configured and what permissions are granted or denied. In the event of a security exception, you 
will likely see an error message indicating the nature of the security violation.

To run the program successfully under a Java Security Manager, you would need to ensure that the
 necessary permissions are granted in the security policy file (e.g., java.policy) or through 
runtime configuration.

It's important to note that running code under a security manager is typically done in situations
 where security is a critical concern, such as in applets or server environments, and requires
 careful configuration and testing to ensure that the application behaves as expected while
 maintaining security.
