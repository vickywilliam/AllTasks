To create an OutOfMemoryError using StringBuffer and then resolve it with and without Garbage 
Collection (GC), you can follow these steps. In this example, we'll use a loop to repeatedly
 append a string to a StringBuffer to consume memory until an OutOfMemoryError occurs:

public class OutOfMemoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            long count = 0;
            while (true) {
                StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
                stringBuffer.append("This is a test string.");
                count++;
                if (count % 100000 == 0) {
                    System.out.println("Records processed: " + count);
                }
            }
        } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
            System.err.println("OutOfMemoryError occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
In this program, we continuously create new StringBuffer instances and append a string to 
them inside the loop. As memory is consumed, eventually an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown.

Now, let's discuss how to resolve this issue with and without Garbage Collection:

Without Garbage Collection (GC):

Increase Heap Size: You can increase the heap size by setting the -Xmx option when running the 
Java application. For example, to allocate 512MB of heap memory, you can use: java -Xmx512m OutOfMemoryExample.
 This allows the program to consume more memory before encountering an OutOfMemoryError.
With Garbage Collection (GC):

Optimize Code: One way to resolve the issue with GC is to optimize your code to minimize memory 
usage. In the original example, you are creating new StringBuffer instances in a loop without 
releasing them, which leads to memory exhaustion. Consider reusing StringBuffer instances or
 using a different data structure if possible.

Manual Garbage Collection: You can manually trigger garbage collection in your code using 
System.gc(). However, this is not a guaranteed way to prevent an OutOfMemoryError because the 
JVM decides when and how to perform garbage collection.

Here's an example of how to manually trigger garbage collection:

public class OutOfMemoryExampleWithGC {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            long count = 0;
            while (true) {
                StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();
                stringBuffer.append("This is a test string.");
                count++;
                if (count % 100000 == 0) {
                    System.out.println("Records processed: " + count);
                    System.gc(); // Trigger garbage collection
                }
            }
        } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
            System.err.println("OutOfMemoryError occurred.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
